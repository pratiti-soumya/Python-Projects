# Python Projects 

This repository showcases a collection of Python mini-projects I have built using Jupyter Notebooks. These projects demonstrate my key skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. Each notebook focuses on a different aspect of data science and reinforces best practices in writing clean, modular, and reusable code.

## 📁 Project Summaries

### 1. [📊 Introduction to Pandas](./Introduction%20to%20Pandas.ipynb)
A beginner-friendly walkthrough of the **Pandas** library. This notebook explores:
- Creating and modifying DataFrames
- Importing CSV files
- Applying basic filters, groupings, and aggregations

**Purpose:** To build fluency in manipulating structured data using Pandas.

### 2. [📐 Mean Normalization and Data Separation](./Mean%20Normalization%20and%20Data%20Separation.ipynb)
This notebook explores:
- **Normalization techniques** to prepare data for machine learning
- Separating feature variables from target labels
- Verifying data readiness through summary statistics and visual inspection

**Purpose:** To understand how to preprocess raw data for modeling tasks.

### 3. [🏆 Oscar Wins Data Exploration](./Oscar%20Wins%20Data%20Exploration.ipynb)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Oscar-winning films with a focus on:
- Trends in award distribution
- Genre and studio analysis
- Visualizing win patterns over time using **Matplotlib**

**Purpose:** To practice real-world data exploration and storytelling with data.
